# Chearmyp Lexer
A lexer for Chearmyp language.

This library represents the source as a queue of tokens.

## Origin
It was in the repository with the parser library. Yet it has been forked as some possible use cases
that may not need as parser.

## Tokens
It has types of tokens which are not explicitly documented in Chearmyp Reference but help in lexing
or parsing the source.
